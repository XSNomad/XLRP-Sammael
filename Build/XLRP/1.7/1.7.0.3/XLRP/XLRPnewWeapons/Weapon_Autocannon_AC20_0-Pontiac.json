The Pontiac 100 is usually seen on the Victor BattleMech and known for its superior firepower. It does, however, suffer from ammo feed issues. AC/20s suffer from <color=#dd7e6b> -2 Recoil/refire penalty </color>, when continuously fired. Your pilots guts skill can counteract this. Additionally, <color=#f79924>AC20s have a damage variance of +/- 10 points of damage.</color>",
