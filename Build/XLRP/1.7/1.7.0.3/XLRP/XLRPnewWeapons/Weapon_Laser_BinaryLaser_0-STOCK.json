        "Details" : "Binary laser weapons, nicknamed Blazers, have existed in Rifle and Pistol form for some time, but the 'Mech-scale Binary Laser Cannon was widely considered a dead-end technology. Taking two large laser cores and fusing them together, the Blazer was designed to fire both cores at the same time, increasing damage penetration. In practice, damage yield proved low compared to the lasers firing separately, and the high heat generated by the Blazer severely taxed available heat sink technology. Like all Lasers, Blazers enjoy a baseline accuracy bonus over other weapons. <color=#f79924>Binary Lasers have a damage variance of +/- 8 points of damage.</color>",
