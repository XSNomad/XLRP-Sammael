The idea behind this was to make it fit into a ballistic hardpoint. It seems not a lot of thought was put into cooling this frankengun, so it accumulates a bit of heat.\r\n\r\nThe twin-mount machine gun connects to the ballistic targeting computer, increasing the effective range compared to standard MGs, but this comes at the cost of <color=#dd7e6b>-1 accuracy</color> and being unable to aim and fire at targets during melee attacks. The two MGs also vibrate heavily under fire, generating <color=#dd7e6b>1 recoil with every attack</color>. Other than that, it works like a normal Machine Gun.\r\n\r\n<b>Firing modes:</b>\r\nBurst: <color=#ffcc00>Default mode</color>\r\nRapid Fire: <color=#ffcc00>+10 shots, +10 heat,\r\n -2 Accuracy, 2 rounds weapon cooldown</color>\r\n\r\n<color=#d9d9d9><b>Firing modes can be changed by clicking the right side of the weapons activation panel during combat.</b></color>",
