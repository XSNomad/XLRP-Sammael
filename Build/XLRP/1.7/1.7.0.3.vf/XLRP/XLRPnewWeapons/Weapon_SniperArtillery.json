As the second most-powerful tube artillery in the Inner Sphere, the Sniper can cripple or destroy most light and medium BattleMechs with a single hit. The weapon has an effective range of 9 kilometers. The Sniper is slightly inaccurate but is capable of dealing damage in a large area of effect via indirect fire. Being a long-range artillery weapon, it is also <color=#dd7e6b>unable to fire on targets at 180 meters or less.</color>\n\nFor standard HE artillery shells, damage is dealt twice; once for a direct hit and as additional damage to all units within the blast radius.",
