The events contained in this mod are primarily for adding and removing pilot tags that are affected by the "pilot quirks" mod used in "Roguetech".
There will be a lot of cut and paste dialog because of this. The main thing for me was getting the tags changed, not writing a good story.
With that said here is a short description of what each event does.

event_mw_endurance_race = adds Athletic tag to shorten fatigue time.

event_mw_goodDeeds_bookish = removes bookish tag to prevent negative stats in gunnery, piloting and guts.

event_mw_goodDeeds_cautious = removes cautious tag to prevent having a "to hit" penalty.

event_mw_goodDeeds_disgraced = removes disgraced tag to prevent loss of company morale.

event_mw_goodDeeds_dishonest = same as disgraced.

event_mw_goodDeeds_jinxed = same as cautious but also removes being easier to be hit.

event_mw_goodDeeds_klutz = removes the klutz tag to prevent stability issues of that quirk.

event_mw_goodDeeds_reckless = removes reckless tag to prevent being easier to be hit.

event_mw_goodDeeds_unstable = removes unstable tag to prevent low morale changes in the pilot.

event_mw_libraryAssassin = adds the Assassin tag for 90 days but requires 3000 unspent XP.

event_mw_libraryLostech = adds the Lostech tag so weapons with the "component_type_lostech" tag have a higher hit chance.
(Includes weapons from rogutech that have been updated with the lostech tag. Example: Gauss, ER, Pulse, LBX, Streak, Ultra, Narc, TAG.)

The following text is the chatty stuff, you can stop reading now, unless you want to know why I have done this.

I like the pilot quirks "idea" but some of the actual effects made it so the pilots I wanted were too flawed for me to enjoy them. So I removed the mod and then felt like I was missing out on the fun aspect of it. When HBS included an event editor in their game I quickly found that some events could be used to add tags to my saved game pilots. So that's how it all started and you are seeing a work in progress based on using events to modify the saved game file.

Most of the events are straight forward but will offer choices that might not give the desired effect. For example: if you choose to "throw a party" in the "Good Deeds" series of events there is a 25% chance you will not get the tag removed, but if you give the pilot special quarters it is 100%. Another example is with the library series of events, if you choose to send them to the simulators they will not get the tag but will gain 3000 XP. This is a way to gain XP on a pilot who you don't want the tag on. Of course if your pilot already has the tag or does not have enough XP to pay for choosing the tag in the first place, they will not be given this mission at all.

Also note the creator of the pilot quirks mod had this to say concerning assassin and lostech changes not showing up in the user interface.. "So, the Assassin tag won't show any indicator in-combat. It will take care of the calculation no problem, though. Same thing with the LosTech tag. That will get a boost for firing the weapon, but the UI won't show anything in-combat."

In closing, you need to know that although I set these events to be "high occurrence" it could take some time before you see one. Some have requirements like the library series will need the argo to have the library upgraded before it will show up.

Enjoy the mod!
