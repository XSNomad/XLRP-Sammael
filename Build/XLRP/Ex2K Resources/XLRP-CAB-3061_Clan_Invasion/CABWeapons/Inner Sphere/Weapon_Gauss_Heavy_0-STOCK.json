While the Heavy Gauss Rifle is extremely powerful, it also suffers from a number of drawbacks. The heavy projectile fired by the rifle experiences a significant loss of velocity, so it is weaker at greater distances. Additionally, the Heavy Gauss Rifle's capacitors are unstable and <color=#f79924>explode for 75 points of damage and 30 points of stability damage if the weapon is struck by weapons fire.</color>",
