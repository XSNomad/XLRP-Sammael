The ultimate Autocannon, the Mitchell DeathGiver, was only seen on two Mechs: The now exctinct Shootist and the mighty KGC-000b King Crab used exclusively by SLDF Royal Units. The DeathGiver features both increased damage output and accuracy; it is also designed to absorb shocks and vibrations, which is why it only has a <color=#dd7e6b> -1 Recoil/refire penalty </color> when continuously fired. Like other AC/20s, <color=#f79924>the DeathGiver has a damage variance of +/- 10 points of damage.</color>",
